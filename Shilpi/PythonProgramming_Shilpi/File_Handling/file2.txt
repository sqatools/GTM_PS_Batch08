The waves beside them danced; but they
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not but be gay,
In such a jocund company:
I gazed and gazed but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
in vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
which is a bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
and dances with the daffodils.
