I WANDERED LONELY AS A CLOUD
THAT FLOATS ON HIGH O'ER VALES AND HILLS,
WHEN ALL AT ONCE I SAW A CROWD,
A HOST, OF GOLDEN DAFFODILS;
BESIDE THE LAKE ,BENEATH THE TREES,
FLUTTERING AND DANCING IN THE BREEZE

CONTINUOUS AS THE STARS THAT SHINE
AND TWINKLE ON THE MILKY WAY,
THEY STRETCHED IN NEVER-ENDING LINE
ALONG THE MARGIN OF A BAY:
TEN THOUSAND SAW I AT A GLANCE,
TOSSING THEIR HEADS IN SPRIGHTLY DANCE.

THE WAVES BESIDE THEM DANCED; BUT THEY
OUT-DID THE SPARKLING WAVES IN GLEE:
A POET COULD NOT BUT BE GAY,
IN SUCH A JOCUND COMPANY:
I GAZED AND GAZED BUT LITTLE THOUGHT
WHAT WEALTH THE SHOW TO ME HAD BROUGHT:

FOR OFT, WHEN ON MY COUCH I LIE
IN VACANT OR IN PENSIVE MOOD,
THEY FLASH UPON THAT INWARD EYE
WHICH IS A BLISS OF SOLITUDE;
AND THEN MY HEART WITH PLEASURE FILLS,
AND DANCES WITH THE DAFFODILS.
