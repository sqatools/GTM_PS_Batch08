Python File Handling Programs refers to the process of manipulating files on a computer using Python programming language.
In Python, you can perform various operations on files such as reading, writing, appending, and deleting files.

To perform file handling in Python, you first need to open a file.
The open() function is used to open a file. It takes two parameters
the file name (along with the path, if necessary) and the mode in which you want to open the file.
